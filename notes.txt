This is a logbook for notes about migration to MongoDB 3.2 and upgrading of Scintilla and QJson libraries.

QScintilla
----------

Upgraded and compiled on Linux (and only on Linux for now) in this way:

cd third-party/qscintilla/Qt4Qt5
qmake qscintilla.pro
make -j5

Shared libs will be located in the same directory
